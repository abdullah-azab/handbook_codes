<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A Competitive Programmers Handbook by Antti Laaksonen is one of the good books which touches each topic for competitive programming. But the problem is that it just touches those topics and it becomes hard for a beginner to grasp those concepts and implement them simultaneously. I guess the book expects the reader to have at least once been introduced to the concepts. This repository comprises of all the possible codes from the same.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Read the book. Unable to understand any part? Come here look at the code.


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [Open issue](https://github.com/pulkit1joshi/handbook_codes/issues) if you want a particular part of the handbook to be implemented earlier or have any issue in the present codes.
- Further, more codes will be added as I get time. :)
